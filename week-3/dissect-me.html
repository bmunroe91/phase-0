      Version control helps track changes, and easily corrects costly errors, by going back to a previous, more stable version. It can help identify when, and who, made what changes as well as allow people to simultaneously collaborate on a single project.

      Git is a very simple and fast way of tracking changes within a shared folder. A user can either group changes together, or publish them indivdually. Either way commiting changes to files is a great way to keep track of your changes, as well as recall them at a later date.

      Github a great way to track changes in your code and already has a large user base and expansive helpful community. It's a great way to check, test, peer review, and submit your code without damaging or even altering the master code.

1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
In this particular challenge I only used a few of the tags I usually use, such as; <head>,<title>, <body>, <h1-6>, <p>, and <article>. I usually use <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <nav>
2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The browser starts with the <head> and identifies the code, character set, and the text to display for the <title>. The <body> is the content and uses <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <nav> among others. <header> contains the most relevant information, like a title to the user, and a <footer> contains sources, contact info., or links. An <article> tag is used for the main content, as well as <section>. An <aside> tag should be used for anything independant of the <body> such as ads or elements "aside" the main idea. A <nav> tag should be used for links navigating elsewhere.
3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I'm glad to see there is a function to add templates quickly within sublime. I haven't gone through the sublime crash course fully, but I can see the benefits of knowing shortcuts as well as snippets to ease the workflow. I will definitely be sure to add snippets and shortcuts to my workflow to boost productivity.
