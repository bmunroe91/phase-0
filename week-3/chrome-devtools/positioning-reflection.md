# How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
DevTools is really helpful because it allows you to alter your css elements without having to switch between pages, and providing a live update of your changes. The work flow is also greatly improved by their auto suggestions of syntax and keyboard shortcuts.
# How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements using the height or width tags and entering values like pixel count (px) percentages (%) or in reference to the default text size (em).
# What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute - Positioned relative to it's positioned ancestor or containg block
Fixed - Is independently fixed from all other elements on the page, i.e. object doesn't move when scrolling
Static - Is the default positioning of an element or it's normal behavior i.e. where it is inside of the html document.
Relative - Lays out element as if it was not positioned,and then adjusts its positioning without changing the layout of the page
# What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin is the space in between elements, Border is the border lines of the element, and padding is the space between the border and the element.
# What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I thought it was useful to incorporate the CSS elements and watch them live to see how they interact. My pair and I did hit a snag on the last challenge that we spent more time than necessary on a very simple solution, which I now understand why CSS is a love/hate relationship.
