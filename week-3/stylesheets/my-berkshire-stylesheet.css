/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
You should be able to identify the directory the styelsheet is in if not relative.
What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
It was somewhat difficult and included a lot of trial and error.
What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
we used height, width, color, background-color and font-size
Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
Yes we used both. We used classes for multiple instances of individual components like letters or line breaks.
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
The actual code was stylized using html. Separating your stylesheets from your html is considered best practice.
