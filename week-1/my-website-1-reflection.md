## Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
First, login to your Github Account. At the top right click the "+" sign and select New Repository. Name your Repository, make it public or private, select your license and whether you want a README file to explain your project. Once your repository is created copy the clone URL. Navigate in terminal to your desired location and type: git clone "https://link" by pasting the link you copied after -git clone. Check and see if the folder is there!
## Describe what open source means.
Open source means anyone can freely distribute, modify and copy an exisiting material.
## What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I have been a fan of open source over proprietary software for a long time now. I know that Linus was very into open source software, and there are still many people trying to push the idea into the mainstream (see the pirate bay). I wouldn't call it Utopia, but it doesn't make me nervous or protective. I like sharing my best recipes with others, and I have the same ideals about software.
## Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow for the protection of Intellectual Property, and also allow for contributors/creators to control their creation to a certain degree. Some people may want to charge for their software, others may not. Either way licenses help combat piracy, infringement and can potentially keep ideas either open and free, or private and for sale.
##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I had a few moments where I was unable to comprehend what I was doing wrong, but mostly it had to do with being in the wrong location, or forgetting to create a branch.
## Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I was able to understand the material with the resources and text provided.
