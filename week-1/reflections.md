## 1.1 Think About Time
For the time management and productivity ideas I read about the "flow state" or being in the "zone", the Pomodoro technique, the Fogg method, meditation, and how to find rhythm. The "flow state" is a state of mind one enters when they are involved in their work and executing it at a high level. This happens when the challenge presented is neither too hard, nor too easy (the goldilocks zone) and one is motivated but not distracted. The Pomodoro technique is simply taking 25 minutes to accomplish something, then taking 5 minutes off to reflect or review. There are other steps however, such as finding the amount of 25 minute intervals it might take to accomplish a certain task, to continually better manage time. The Fogg method helps determine what psychological factors must be achieved in order to provoke a behavior, which there are three; motivation, ability, and triggers.

"Time Boxing" is when a deadline is set, and no matter what's done or what isn't the work will conclude at said deadline. This would be beneficial in phase 0 if one task is taking too long, or longer than others, moving on when necessary. Currently I'm practicing meditation and finding my rhythm to begin to help managing my time, but I want to incorporate the ideas above. My work schedule has somewhat interfered with my strategy, but I am in a better position to control that now. I intend to employ the Pomodoro technique, "Time boxing", and concentrating on finding flow though meditation and practice.

My overall plan for time management in Phase 0 is to accomplish as much as possible on the first day the material is made available (while using aforementioned techniques), and to manage time over the rest of the week to complete material early and move onto bonus material.
##  1.2 The Command Line
A shell is an interface, either CLI or GUI that allows users to access an operating system.

Bash is a Unix shell and command language that is the default shell on Linux and OS X

I did not find this material particularly challenging as I have had some prior experience with using the command line and bash. I was successfully able to use all the commands in the crash course, and doing so really helped me understand the concepts and movement better. I would have to say that -help is by far the most important command, as well as -cd -ls -pwd -grep -mkdir -rmdir- rm and -less.

-pwd "print working directory": shows user which directory they are located in

-ls : lists files and directories inside of a directory

-mv : moves files

-cd : changes directory

-../ :moves up a directory

-touch : makes an empty file

-less : displays text inside file

-rmdir : removes directory

-rm : remove file

-help : displays commands and their uses
