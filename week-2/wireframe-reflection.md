## What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a screen blueprint or schematic of the framework and layout of a website.
## What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows a designer to design a website's overall look and feel without having to worry about all the smaller details. This makes it easier to keep the UX in mind, and make sure your website will be accessible no matter the color scheme, font, etc.
## Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I had a pretty good time looking up other websites as a reference and mentally planning my own. I can see how it's easy to get lost in the design process. I used Mockingbird's online editor.
## Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I revised my wireframe for my blog, but if I did it differently I would've added more details to the layout, also being restricted to Mockingbirds default tools made the layout somewhat uninspired.
## What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I was curious about what the "best" wireframing tool was out there, but I found that it's a matter of personal preference. The link provided in the course helped me locate one.
## Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I found the searching for a wireframing tool was the most tedious. Most require payment or at least registration to access most functions. I enjoyed the actual wireframing however once I found a tool.
