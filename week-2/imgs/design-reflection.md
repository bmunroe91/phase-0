## What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
This will be my professional website for potential employers. I will have my resume, photo, and current projects, as well as links to my blog and social media networks.
## What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience would be mainly interested in my work history and education, which will be easy navigate to.
## What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
Each user should be able to quickly view my resume, why I would be an asset to their organization, and then contact me as well.
## What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
UXD is not universal for either users or websites. It takes research and trial and error. UXD may seem like an unecessary expense but it has proven to provide revenue over time. It is not the same as usablity, but usability is a factor in overall UXD.
## What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
UX for short is how the user feels while using a system, not to be confused with usability. UXDesign helps ease of access, usability and provides a pleasurable experience for the user. Good systems should have a good UX across every available platform, which are seen with sites like Google or Amazon. A good UX can potentially increase revenue, especialy over time.
## Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found the research to be tedious but necessary. I really just want to code now, but I felt the information helped.
