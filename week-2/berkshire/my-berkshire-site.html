<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was actually really fun to finally be able to implement the HTML I learned and create a very simple website.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
There were only two things I needed to research, the copyright and trademark symbols, and those were extremely easy to locate.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We did use height and width for the geico image, but other than that there was no formatting.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I like HTML because it's pretty straightforward and the open/close format makes it easy to keep track of. I'm not quite sure what the bad is, but I would think it has to do with formatting, and CSS as a necessary tool.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Almost everything has an open and a close <></>. Always start with a head, then fill the body with content. Other than that just keeping up with syntax.
