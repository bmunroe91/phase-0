What does puts do?
Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console.
What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is any digit without a decimel inbetween. A float contains integers and a decimel.
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division will output floats only. Integer division will output integers only, so you shouldn't expect a remainder or decimel(float) point in the answer.

```ruby
puts 24*365

puts 60*24*265*10
```
