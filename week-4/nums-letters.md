What does puts do?
Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console.
What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is any digit without a decimel inbetween. A float contains integers and a decimel.
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division will output floats only. Integer division will output integers only, so you shouldn't expect a remainder or decimel(float) point in the answer.

```ruby
puts 24*365

puts 60*24*265*10
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Almost as similar as regular math, except when dealing with division of integers and floats. With integers the quotient will always be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
What is the difference between integers and floats?
integers are any whole number, floats contain decimels.
What is the difference between integer and float division?
With integers the quotient will always be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Floats will contain the actual answer
What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are lines of letters or numbers as text. You would use them as outputs or inputs of actual text in programs.
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
local variables are defined by the programmer to contain any combination of strings, integers, floats, or programs even.
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
I did, it was a great refresher
